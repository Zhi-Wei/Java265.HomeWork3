* Problem 6: Caesar cipher. Write a program which implements Caesar Cipher. Define the Cipher class to encrypt your plain text with a decipher method to decrypt the cipher text. In addition, you may write another class used to test your Caesar cipher program. The program should output the plain text, its cipher text, and also decrypted text. For example,

* Problem 7: Rock-paper-scissors. Write a program which conducts a rock-paper-scissors game (RPS game, in short) with two computer players. The RPS game continues until one of computer players wins. If you can implement a two-player game, then you may try to implement a multi-player version of RPS game. You can find a demo clip [here](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~d00922011/java/263/RPSGameDemo.mov) for the multi-player RPS game. Strongly recommend that you use OO design elements, say class, interfaces, enum types, and so on. (If you cannot watch mov files, please use the online convertor to convert mov files into the video types you can read on your machine.
